:wave: Hi everyone...

If you want to be good at coding, do a lot of coding. right? so in this Repository there are several solutions that I worked on in solving the challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

It was difficult at first, because I'm still new to this coding world. I wish I could improve my coding skills. so if you all have any advice for me, feel free to advise me.

The folder name represents the challenge. I just copy and paste from the frontend mentor. each challenge folder contains the solutions that I completed, usually there are 2 files that I create (**mysolution.html** and **style.css**), these are for basic challenges (HTML and CSS).
